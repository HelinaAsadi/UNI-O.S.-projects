two examples of MFT &amp; MVT and a Memory Management example

Memory Management :
This code implements three methods for memory management :
1. First Fit
2. Best Fit
3. Worst Fit

After choosing desirable method, U need to enter :
_ total memory size
_ size of each memory page
_ size of every process

After that the program allocates the appropriate page to each process (if possible) according to the method that U chose earlier, and informs user of all detail.
At last it calculates and prints both internal and external fragmentation.
