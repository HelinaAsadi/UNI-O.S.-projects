two examples of MFT &amp; MVT and an example of Memory Management

MFT :
For a fixed size memory (1000 blocks) and fixed size pages (200 blocks), U need to enter the size of each process.
Then, after allocating appropriate pages to processes (if possible), the program calculates and prints both internal and external fragmentation.


MVT :
For a fixed size memory (1000 blocks), U need to enter the size of each process.
Then, after allocating appropriate pages to each process (if possible), the program calculates and prints the external fragmentation.


Memory Management :
This code implements three methods for memory management :
1. First Fit
2. Best Fit
3. Worst Fit
After choosing desirable method, U need to enter :
_ total memory size
_ size of each memory page
_ size of every process
After that the program allocates the appropriate pages to processes (if possible) according to the method that U chose earlier, and informs user of all details.
At last it calculates and prints both internal and external fragmentation.
