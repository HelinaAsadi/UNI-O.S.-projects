two examples of MFT &amp; MVT and a Memory Management example

MFT :
Two examples of MFT & MVT. For a fixed memory and in the MFT case for fixed pages, the program gets the size of memory each process needs and then allocates the needed blocks or pages to each process.. Then calculates the external fragmentation for MVT, and both external and internal fragmentation for MFT


MVT :

Memory Management :
This code implements three methods for memory management :
1. First Fit
2. Best Fit
3. Worst Fit
After choosing desirable method, U need to enter :
_ total memory size
_ size of each memory page
_ size of every process
After that the program allocates the appropriate page to each process (if possible) according to the method that U chose earlier, and informs user of all detail.
At last it calculates and prints both internal and external fragmentation.
